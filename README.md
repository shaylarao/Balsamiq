# UI and Workflow of Clean Earth using Balsamiq
## This is the UI workflow of a hypothetical app called Clean Earth
### The goal of this project was to properly understand how to use UI tools such as Balsamiq and visualize the workflow of a mobile app. Clean Earth is an app that allows users to find local community service projects. It incentivises helping the community and environment by having easy access to opportunities while also having a point system that increases per job completed and an ability to network with likeminded individuals.
### This app allows you to:
* Create a login so that your work is saved
* Create a Profile so that you can be recognized for your work and meet other users
* View where you are located and view community service jobs in your area
* Expand your network by adding friends
* Create a new job such as "Garbage Cleanup at the Beach"
* View Jobs available
